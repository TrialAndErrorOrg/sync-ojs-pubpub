(2022) implements such a digital nudge via a mobile device aiming at medication adherence. Besides methodological and practical shortcomings outlined by the authors themselves, the used adherence nudge might have had conceptual weaknesses. In the present article, I reflect on three prominent challenges of digital nudges in general and an emerging redemption of the nudging-concept in the form of so-called boosts. Both reflections inform the evaluation of the outcomes of the Gloria Adherence Subproject and suggest specific actions for optimization for future project retrials or conceptual replications by other scientists."

          "text": " in the Gloria Adherence Subproject designed a between-subjects study with one experimental and one control group to test the effect of an adherence nudge on medication intake in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. In the former group, patients were equipped with an app on their mobile device that reminded them daily to take their required medication, in the form of a pill, if they had not already done so. The control group was presented with no such intervention. Pill intake was measured via screening the removal of the electronic cap of the used pill bottles. The authors found no effects of the adherence nudge on patients‘ consistency in taking their medication. While Hartman and colleagues already consider practical and methodological shortcomings of the subproject in exemplary extensiveness, I want to address potential problems of the intervention itself and of digital nudges more generally. That is, the null results of the adherence nudging demonstrated in the Gloria Adherence Subproject stimulate further, more general, questions about the limits of digital nudging which are the focus of the present paper. I reflect on three challenges of digital nudging prominently discussed in intervention research, and on an emerging and commendable improvement of the nudging-concept named boosting. Beforehand, however, a general outline of digital nudges is needed."

In short, nudges run the grave risk of patronizing their addressees and are, on top of this, (mostly) undetectable and uncontrollable for them, denying any chance for users to become aware of their passivity. In the Gloria Adherence Subproject specifically, the message nudge was predetermined in presentation (i.e., when displayed) and content (i.e., nudging message) format, allowing no possibility for participants to adapt it to their individual needs (e.g., their daily routine)."

Due to their simple and straightforward design, nudges are especially useful for resource-efficient short term effects. However, this also means that their impact runs out rather quickly and is susceptible to moments of inattention.

For a potential future retrial of the Gloria Adherence Subproject, I suggest not just scrutinizing the methodological and practical circumstances as described by the authors but also integrating a more effective, long-term oriented version of their adherence intervention. Instead of merely reminding patients to take their daily medication, researchers could provide them with additional information. For instance, the mobile device could provide an accessible information glossary of the pill, its effects, and the importance of taking it at repeated and consistent intervals. Further, patients could be informed about their past pill intake behavior, being motivated by streaks of adherence (i.e., "

Allowing patients to understand the reasons for and consequences of the nudged behavior and offering them the opportunity to screen their behavioral performance should foster patients’ competencies, with the long-term effect that pill intake (and any other medication adherence for that matter) grows more reliable. Via the above-described suggestion of a boosting advancement, participants would be more aware of how the medication intervention works and would be allowed to adapt the intake (in a limited way) to their individual routine, enabling them to have more control over the intervention by themselves. Further, advancing the adherence nudge should also address issues of time decay. Informing participants effectively about the idea of the implemented adherence intervention should raise their awareness of the importance of medication intake and also boost the cognitive prominence of having to take the medication. Lastly, fostering the participants’ own competencies regarding their medication intake (e.g., being more informed and in more control) should allow them to adapt more dynamically to issues that arise unexpectedly. This increase in effective navigation of one’s environment should also help individuals to avoid backlash effects – for example, from unexpected personal events interfering with the planned medication intake. In summary, boosting has the potential to improve participants’ agency in the experimental group, intercept effect decay over time, and make the intervention more robust against complex moderators in the environment."
